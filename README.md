# About this project
This is a GitHub Action intended to simplify the development experience while deploying with Docker Swarm.

### Features:
- üòÉ Simple to use
- üèóÔ∏è Bring your own container + configuration
- üíØ Replicate 100% of production from Development to CI to Deployment
- üí™ Use with self-hosted registries
- üßÆ Store MD5 hashes in environment variables for deployment
- üîê Use with private registries
- üè† Use .env files for deployment

# Usage
Here is an example workflow:

```yml
name: Production Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: serversideup/github-action-docker-swarm-deploy@v3
        with:
          ssh_deploy_private_key: "${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}"
          ssh_remote_hostname: "${{ secrets.SSH_REMOTE_HOSTNAME }}"
          registry: "ghcr.io"
          registry-username: "${{ github.actor }}"
          registry-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

### Getting the MD5 Checksum of a file
We include an optional input to get the MD5 checksum of a file. This is useful if you're working with Docker Configs and you only want the service to update if the file has changed. You just need to set the following inputs (a full example is available at the top of this document):

```yml
steps:
  - uses: serversideup/github-action-docker-swarm-deploy@v3
    with:
      md5_file_path: "./path/to/my/file.txt"
      md5_variable_name: "MY_FILE_MD5"
```

This will store the MD5 checksum of the file at `./path/to/my/file.txt` in the environment variable `MY_FILE_MD5`.

### Using an .env file
You can use an .env file to set environment variables for your container. This is useful if you're working with environment variables that are different for each environment. You can set the .env file as a base64 encoded string and it will be decoded and loaded into the container.

```yml
steps:
  - uses: serversideup/github-action-docker-swarm-deploy@v3
    with:
      env_file_base64: "${{ secrets.ENV_FILE_BASE64 }}"
```

To set the value of `ENV_FILE_BASE64`, you can use the following command:

```bash
cat .env | base64
```

Any variable set in the .env file will be available to the deployment to be used in your docker-compose.yml file.

For example, if you have a .env file with the following:

```
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

Then you can use the following in your docker-compose.yml file: 

```yml
services:
  mysql:
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=${{ env.DB_HOST }}
      - DB_PORT=${{ env.DB_PORT }}
      - DB_USER=${{ env.DB_USER }}
      - DB_PASSWORD=${{ env.DB_PASSWORD }}
```
